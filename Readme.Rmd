## Volcanoes on Venus


One of the most important problems for the geological analysis of Venus is the detection of volcanoes in its surface. The Magellan spacecraft was able to gather 30,000 images of Venus' surface over an approximately four year period from 1990--1994 [$^1$](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Volcanoes+on+Venus+-+JARtool+experiment). However, it is impractical to do this classification by hand, as human experts become fatigued after labeling only 50-100 images over a few days.[$^2$](https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1023/A:1007400206189.pdf) Hence there is a real need to automate this process. 

Our goal with this project is to apply the machine learning techniques that we will learn in class to solve this important problem, as well as to determine which is the best suited for this task.
